## 1) Almost in. Still a bit of talking.


Here we'll code as cooking. You'll discover a lot of new ingredients. It's normal to be a bit afraid to use them at first. The way we'll use to get to know them is to use them. More and more. Don't be afraid of making mistakes, we promise you, you can't break anything.

## 2) 4 paths of knowledge:
 * Skills. Tech skills.
 * Possibilities. Input, Output, Brains.
 * Scenography. The physical part of the virtual
 * Stylisation. Let's make my art mine. 

## 3) Our weapon of choixe

We'll be using P5JS Javascript. It's great, trust us. Long story short, it's taking inspiration from Processing, and inherit its ease of usage and utter fun to play with. Add to that a little present barely ever found in programming language, and there you have why we decided upon it.

While it won't be of use right now, you might want to get [the reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) kept open somewhere. Good for inspiration, to check examples, and to learn about stuff.

And now for the most important, our lovely lively editor: [block builder](http://blockbuilder.org/). The little gem we talked earlier is called "hot reloading". This means that whenever you change your code, the result is updated live. While this might seem a defacto situation, it is not in most of user cases. Of course, this solution is not the best on each aspect, but for beginners it is god sent.
