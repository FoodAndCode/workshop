## 1) A line, a triangle, a sphere... vectors

  * Definition of a vector
  * Fun with math: max, min, map, abs, randomGaussian
!!CODE HERE?!?!

## 2) Natural Behavior
  * Inputs are orders.
  * Natural structures are appeasing and nice to the eye, and as such a good inspiration
  * Orders in natures are forces. And physic tells us that it's link with acceleration

  * Previous code was 'ordered' in position.

  * Speed = what you add in position at each steps. The bigger the speed, the further you'll go.
  * Acceleration = what you add to speed at each steps. The bigger the acceleration, the quicker you'll go.

```javascript
    var p, s, a; // position, speed, acceleration

    function setup() {
        p = 0;
        

    }



```
